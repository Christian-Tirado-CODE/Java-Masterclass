         Packages:
           - Allow you to group classes and interfaces together to prevent or manage naming conflicts between developers.
           - When importing two classes with the same name you have specify one of them in your imports.
           -  You use the asterisk symbol(*) when you want to import all the classes and interfaces from a given folder.

         Challenge:
          Create a suitably named package containing a class called Series with the following static methods:
          nSum(int n) returns the sum of all numbers from 0 to n. The first ten numbers are:
         factorial(int n) returns the product of all numbers from 1 to n.
         fibonacci(int n) returns the nth Fibonacci number.

         When you have tested your functions, delete the Main class and produce a jar file.

         Create a new project and add your Series library, then test the three methods in the main() method of your new project.
